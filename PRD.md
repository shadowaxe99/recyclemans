# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview

The project aims to create a robust medical coding and Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) solution. The system will handle all aspects of medical coding and RCM, including patient registration, insurance and benefit verification, medical coding, charge capture, claim submission, payment posting, and follow-up on denied claims.

## Target Audience

The target audience for this product are healthcare providers, medical coders, billing specialists, and administrative staff in healthcare facilities.

## User Stories

As a healthcare provider, I want a system that can handle all aspects of medical coding and RCM so that I can focus on providing care to my patients.

As a medical coder, I want a system that can automate the coding process so that I can work more efficiently and accurately.

As a billing specialist, I want a system that can handle the entire RCM process so that I can manage claims and payments more effectively.

## Functional Requirements

The system should be able to:

1. Register new patients and manage their information.
2. Verify insurance details and benefits of patients.
3. Handle medical coding using the latest coding standards.
4. Capture charges for the services provided.
5. Submit claims to insurance providers.
6. Post payments received from insurance providers and patients.
7. Follow-up on denied claims and manage appeals.

## Non-Functional Requirements

The system should be:

1. Reliable: The system should be available and functional at all times.
2. Secure: The system should ensure the privacy and security of patient data.
3. Scalable: The system should be able to handle a large number of patients and claims.
4. User-friendly: The system should be easy to use and navigate.

## Wireframes

[Include wireframes or mockups of the user interface to illustrate the desired design and layout of the product.]

## Technical Requirements

The system will be developed using Python and will use libraries like pandas for data processing, sklearn for machine learning, and flask for the web interface.

## Assumptions and Constraints

The development of the system assumes that all necessary data for medical coding and RCM is available and accessible. The system is constrained by the accuracy and completeness of this data.

## Risks and Mitigation

One potential risk is the inaccuracy of medical coding, which can be mitigated by implementing a robust coding engine and regular audits. Another risk is the violation of data privacy, which can be mitigated by implementing strong security measures.

## Timeline

The development and delivery of the product will take approximately 6 months.

## Budget

The budget allocated for the project is $100,000.
